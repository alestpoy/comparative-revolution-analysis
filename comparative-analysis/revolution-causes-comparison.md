# Comparative Analysis: Causes of the Russian and Chinese Revolutions

This document initiates a comparative examination of the causes that led to the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the Chinese Revolution of the mid‑20th century. The goal is to identify parallels and divergences in the structural, political, and ideological factors that precipitated these two landmark revolutions.

## Current Status

- **Russian Revolution**: A detailed analysis of causes has been completed and is available in [`russian‑revolution/causes.md`](../russian‑revolution/causes.md). The analysis covers the legacy of the 1905 Revolution, the social transformations wrought by industrialization, the shift from Enlightenment ideals to revolutionary communism, and the immediate catalysts of 1917.

- **Chinese Revolution**: The causes of the Chinese Revolution are still pending research. A placeholder file exists at [`chinese‑revolution/causes.md`](../chinese‑revolution/causes.md), awaiting substantive content.

## Preliminary Observations

While a full comparison will be possible only after the Chinese Revolution analysis is finished, a few preliminary points can be noted:

1. **Imperialism and Anti‑Imperialist Sentiment**: Both revolutions unfolded in contexts of intense foreign pressure—Russia as a contender in the European imperial system, China as a semi‑colonized state subjected to Western and Japanese domination. Anti‑imperialist rhetoric played a mobilizing role in each case, though its articulation differed (Lenin’s theory of imperialism vs. Mao’s emphasis on national liberation).

2. **Social‑Economic Backdrop**: Russia’s rapid, state‑driven industrialization created a concentrated urban proletariat; China remained a predominantly peasant society. Consequently, the class base of the revolutionary movements diverged—urban workers in Russia, rural peasants in China—shaping the strategies of the respective communist parties.

3. **Ideological Adaptation**: Both revolutions were guided by Marxist‑Leninist theory, but each adapted it to local conditions. Lenin’s “vanguard party” model was refined by Mao into a “mass line” approach that prioritized peasant mobilization and protracted people’s war.

## Next Steps

1. Complete the research and drafting of `chinese‑revolution/causes.md`.
2. Expand this document to systematically compare the two sets of causes, drawing on the completed analysis files.
3. Extend the comparison to ideological influences (`ideology.md`) and the role of anti‑imperialist sentiment (`anti‑imperialism.md`).
